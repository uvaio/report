\section{Discussion} 

The main findings of the report show the significance of the comprehensive approach that was employed for the restructuring of the collection. The implementation of the website makes the data accessible to various user groups and highlights the relevance of archaeological findings. The machine learning model shows satisfactory results and therefore ensures completeness of the data.  The initial dataset being a flat dump of data posed challenges for ontology, machine learning and visualization which we tackled by normalizing the data sets. The information like related objects was stored as plain text in the initial dataset which made it challenging to ensure the objects are related based on identifiers.
