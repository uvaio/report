The starting point for re-organizing the collection, creating aggregated datasets, and exploring overview data is the dataset downloadable in \textit{.csv} format on the Below the Surface project website. During the excavations around 700,000 objects were found, the dataset is a subset and contains around 20,000 objects that are digitally processed and rudimentary labeled. A separate data field description \footnote{https://belowthesurface.amsterdam/en/pagina/publicaties-en-datasets} file can be downloaded which further explains the controlled vocabulary used for the dataset.
