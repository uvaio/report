\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the structuring of the Below the Surface collection has been a comprehensive effort. It incorporates data organization, user personas, development of an ontology, data modeling and the integration of a machine learning model. Collectively this has resulted in the implementation of a website that can visualize the goals of the project: grouping objects by functional properties, exploring cultural relevance and research object relationships of parts. The accessibility of the website is improved by the ability to filter through object subsets and user-centric design principles. The machine learning model that was used to complete missing and unclassified data, achieved a satisfactory accuracy of approximately 75\%. These results indicate that the insights are a valuable contribution to the classification of the archaeological collection.
