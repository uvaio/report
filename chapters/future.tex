\subsubsection{Website}

Additional visualization features and filter options need to be added to the website in the next iteration of the website. Currently, the website only visualizes broad categories but there are more subcategories in the dataset that the user might be able to click on to get more detailed views and overlays. From a user experience point of view, further usability testing needs to be done to validate the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) of the prototype website. Direct feedback from the users would further validate the workings of the website and uncover hidden interface and interaction problems. From a technical perspective, the website currently relies on exported data that is then loaded into the web visualization. A further enhancement for the website, and to make it more dynamic, is to have the dataset exposed through a Query-like API (e.g. GraphQL \footnote{https://graphql.org/}) with an underlying 'headless' database (e.g. MongoDB \footnote{https://www.mongodb.com/}) in which the website is able to fetch up-to-date collection real-time data. This also allows for more performant and dynamic filter options on the 'create a subset page' through the use of a back-end.
