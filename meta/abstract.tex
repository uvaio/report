The paper focuses on the organising and visualization of the artifacts present in "Below the Surface" website, which we found while performing excavations during the construction of Amsterdam's North/South metro line. The project includes data organization, persona based website development, ontology creation, data modeling, and implementation of a machine learning model to enrich the data sets. The website is a user-friendly platform, enabling users to explore and filter the objects and the machine learning model enhances data completeness. Our results shares the successful realization of these goals, making the collection more accessible for various user personas. Future work involves further enhancing the website with additional visualizations and improved data quality and completeness.
