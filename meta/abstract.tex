\begin{abstract}
Over 700,000 objects were found during the excavations of the North/Southline and digitally processed during the "Below the Surface" project. This study focuses on the organizing and visualization of these objects by creating a website that re-organizes the collection, an ontology, a data model, and the implementation of a machine learning model to enrich the dataset. Our results share the successful realization of these goals, making the collection more accessible for various user personas. Future work involves further enhancing the website with additional visualizations and improved data quality and completeness.
